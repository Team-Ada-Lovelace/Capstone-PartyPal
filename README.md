## Getting Started

Sync and seed your database by running npm run seed. Running npm run start:dev will make great things happen!

start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
